This directory contains a very basic implemention of an example
REST API client for OpenL2M, written in Python.

Use at your own peril, and test before using against a production instance of OpenL2M!

Files are:

openl2m.py

Implements the OpenL2M Server() and Device() classes that can be used
 to talk to the REST API.

client-example.py

Shows some use cases on how to use the OpenL2M class objects to talk to the REST API.


Please read the content of each file to study how to use them!

Good luck!

"the OpenL2M team".
